# "A C# console application designed to manage a list of bands and their corresponding ratings."

## 📖 Description

This is a very basic application that I developed solely to learn the fundamental concepts of C#, a language I am currently learning. It served as a starting point for me to grasp the basics in a practical and interactive manner. I hope to share more complex projects in the future, but every journey begins with a single step.
